# hello-world

** Intro repository **

Hello all, I am a self-taught programmer who loves to learn new concepts every day. I look forward to finding a team of collaborators on here to work on some ambitious projects, such as:

1. A Life Simulator using a couple of JS frameworks. A self-contained and evolving ecosystem with neural networks attached to each of the organisms with a volatile environment.
2. A chess variant.
3. Websites that utilize a 3D framework such as three.js for certain aspects of their page.
4. Some type of forum for coders who share the same ambitious goals to gather.
5. And much more, I will continue to update this as my interests grow.
